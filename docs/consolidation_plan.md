# Astro.fm: Consolidation & Rebranding Plan (V2)

Following the UX audit, we are moving toward a highly focused, 4-5 hub architecture that reduces navigation friction and clarifies the app's mental model.

## 1. The Core Hubs

### 🗼 Hub 1: The Radar (Home)
**Status**: Refined
*   **Focus**: Maximum immediacy. 
*   **Key Feature**: **Today's Sound**. A one-tap sensory check-in for the current planetary weather.
*   **Daily Horoscope**: The "Today's Reading" card stays here as the primary cognitive focus.
*   **Consolidation**: Moving the generic "Generate" logic here to be a "Daily Resonance" triggered playlist.

### 🏺 Hub 2: The Soul (Sound + Transits)
**Status**: Merged
*   **Focus**: The astronomical blueprint.
*   **Key Feature**: **Natal-to-Transit Mapping**. 
*   **The Experience**: Users can view their Natal Chart and then "toggle" or "overlay" the current Sky (Transits). It answers: *"How is the sky hitting my soul today?"*
*   **Consolidation**: The transit data previously on the "Align" page is now integrated into the Sound wheel for a complete astronomical view.

### 🌌 Hub 3: The Circle (Connections + Synastry)
**Status**: Merged & Social
*   **Focus**: Cosmic community.
*   **Key Feature**: **Direct Alignment**.
*   **The Experience**: You no longer go to a separate tab to "Align" with a friend. You tap a friend in your constellation, and the alignment calculation happens directly within their profile card.
*   **Consolidation**: All "Friend Target" logic from the old Align tab is relocated here.

### 🧪 Hub 4: [REBRANDED] The Lab / The Tuning Fork
**Status**: Rebranded & Specialized
*   **Focus**: Sonic Wellness & Frequency Therapy.
*   **Old Content**: Was "Align" (which felt like a utility).
*   **New Content**: **Cosmic Prescriptions & Attunement**. 
*   **The Experience**: This is a destination for therapeutic sound. Using Hz frequencies to balance "Gaps" in your chart. It moves away from "scores" and toward "healing."

### 🗝️ Hub 5: [REBRANDED] The Sanctum (Profile + Settings)
**Status**: Merged & Aesthetic
*   **Focus**: Identity & Privacy.
*   **New Content**: Combines **User Profile**, **Birth Data**, **Music Genres**, and **Technical Settings**.
*   **The Experience**: A high-end, secure vault for your personal details. It combines the aesthetic parts of the Profile (Avatar/Signs) with the utility parts of Settings.

## 3. Implementation Priorities (Phase 2 Roadmap)

1.  **The Soul Engine**: Update the Sound Screen to accept Transit data overlays (Ghost Orbs/Aspect Arcs).
2.  **The Synastry Card**: Build the "Quick-Align" logic into the Friend Profile and Constellation Map.
3.  **Sanctum Architecture**: Create a single responsive view that houses the 3-tab sub-navigation (Identity, Preferences, System).
4.  **Lab Rebranding**: Remove "Alignment Scores" from this page and pivot the UI purely to "Sonic Healing" and "Tuning."
    *   *Proposed Name*: **"Resonate"** or **"Tuning"** or **"The Well"**.

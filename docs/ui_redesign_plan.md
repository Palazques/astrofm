# Astro.fm UI/UX Redesign: The "Core Hub" Blueprint

This plan outlines the visual and interactive restructuring of the **Home** and **Playlist** experiences to improve flow and sensory clarity.

---

## 🏗️ 1. The NEW Home Screen: "The Celestial Dashboard"
*Merging the Sound page into Home.*

### Visual Hierarchy
1.  **THE TOGGLE (Top Center)**: A sleek, pill-shaped switcher: `[ MY SOUL | THE SKY ]`.
    *   **MY SOUL**: Focuses on the Natal Chart.
    *   **THE SKY**: Focuses on Today's Transits.
2.  **THE RADIUS (Middle)**: The large, interactive **Birth Chart Wheel**. 
    *   In **My Soul** mode: Shows your natal planets with their Hz frequencies.
    *   In **The Sky** mode: Overlays a "Ghost Wheel" of current transit positions on top of your natal wheel.
3.  **THE MESSAGE (Bottom Stack)**: 
    *   The **Daily Reading** card (Horizontal glassmorphic card).
    *   **Frequency Breakdown**: Small planet pills that expand on tap to tell the "vibe" of that planet today.

### Interactive "Feel"
*   **The Blend**: As you toggle from "My Soul" to "The Sky", the central Sound Orb shifts from deep purples (Internal) to electric yellows (External/Daily).
*   **Tactile Wheel**: Spinning the chart wheel provides haptic feedback and triggers individual planet sounds (Hz tones).

## 🎵 2. The NEW Tab: "The Soundscape" (Playlists)
*Moving all music components to a dedicated exploration hub.*

### Visual Hierarchy
1.  **THE FEATURE (Top)**: **The Zodiac Season Card**. 
    *   This is now the "Star of the Show." It’s large, immersive, and features the "Play on Spotify" button.
2.  **THE ARCHIVE (Middle)**: **"Past Frequencies"**.
    *   A horizontal carousel of previously generated playlists based on past "Daily Resonances."
3.  **THE SYNASTRY MIXES (Bottom)**: 
    *   Playlists generated from your **Friend Alignments**. 
    *   *Visual*: Split-color cards (e.g., Pink/Teal) representing the blend of two people's tastes.

### Interactive "Feel"
*   **Vinyl-Style Cards**: Each playlist card should "lift" and glow when scrolled into focus.
*   **Direct Sync**: A prominent widget at the top-right shows your Spotify connection status (e.g., "Syncing with @Paul_Spotify").

## 🗺️ 3. Navigation Map (Revised)

| Button | Label | Hub Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📡 | **Radar** | **The New Home**. Chart Wheel + Daily Reading + Sound Toggles. |
| 🎵 | **Soundscape**| **New Playlist Hub**. Zodiac Season + Generated Mixes + Spotify Sync. |
| 🌌 | **Circle** | **Connections**. Constellation Map + Direct Friend Alignment. |
| 🧪 | **The Well** | **Tuning & Lab**. Hz Meditations + Gaps/Resonance Prescriptions. |
| 🗝️ | **Sanctum** | **Rebranded Settings/Profile**. Birth Data + Genres + Account. |

## 🌊 4. UX Benefits
*   **Reduced "App Anxiety"**: The user no longer has to hunt for their birth chart—it's the first thing they see.
*   **Clearer Intent**: When in **Radar**, they are "Learning." When in **Soundscape**, they are "Listening."
*   **Magical Moments**: Aligning with a friend now feels like a social event (in the Circle), and the resulting playlist feels like a reward (in the Soundscape).
